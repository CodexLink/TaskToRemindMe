# Welcome / Introduction

## Getting Started

Before you get started on this project. Keep in mind that this project was built at C++11. The reason is, some functionalities conforms to what I want. And generally, C++11 is by default the bare minimum C++ version that I could possibly make out of.

## Prerequisites

...

## Deployment

Soon.

## Built with

* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - A Scalable IDE with Multiple Supported Essential Extension and Components for Easy Development and Integration.
* Visual Studio 2016 Build Tools

## Contributing

This will be written soon.

## Versioning

I don't use any software versioning yet. But instead I usually do using time and date in 24H format, in short, datestamp. For example:

```text
When Build is done: at 4:51 PM at 08/21/2018
Result Versioning is: (PostWork|Initial).082118.1651
```
